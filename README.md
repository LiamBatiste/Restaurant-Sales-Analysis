# Restaurant-Sales-Analysis

### Introduction
Welcome to my Restaurant Sales Analysis repository! This project was developed to address critical challenges in the fast food industry. The primary goal is to internally benchmark key metrics that can help the business improve overall efficiency and maximise profits.

### **Problem Statement:**
To enhance the internal competitive positioning and operational efficiency of the restaurant chain, it is crucial to identify key performance drivers and areas for improvement across the menu offerings, store locations, and customer behaviors. Through comprehensive analysis of sales trends, ingredient usage, customer purchase patterns, and store-specific performance, I aim to establish benchmarks that will inform strategic decisions, optimise resource allocation, and improve profitability. By comparing these internal metrics against industry standards and best practices, I seek to uncover actionable insights that will lead to more effective pricing strategies, better inventory management, and enhanced customer satisfaction across all locations.

# Python Data Cleaning and Peparation

To ensure accurate and meaningful analysis, the first step was to prepare the dataset. This involved several key processes:

Data Cleaning:

**- Handling Missing Values: Removed or imputed missing data to ensure consistency.**
**- Data Type Conversion: Converted data types (e.g., dates, numerical values) to the correct formats for analysis.**
**- Removing Duplicates: Identified and removed any duplicate records to maintain data integrity.**
